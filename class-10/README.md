- Announcements
	- **Reminder:** Weekly surveys are assigned in Canvas. Your survey responses are very helpful and meaningful to us. Feedback is a gift.
	- The instructor will have a 15-minute one-on-one meeting with each student during the coming week: this will be an opportunity to review your progress, answer any questions you have, and discuss any topics the instructor sees appropriate, such as your future plans in the program. We will start the process of scheduling those meetings very soon.
- [Readings and various topics](#readings) *[30 minutes]*
- [Various topics](#smattering) *[75 minutes]*

## Code demo for today's lab

Today's lab is a 'one-off' lab, in that it is not directly connected to your weekly project.

You'll be working individually today. The GitHub workflow today is different, too, and is designed to give you a lot of practice working with branches, which is the last major piece of Git for us to cover. We need to spend a bit of time with it, and get practice with it, so that you understand what you are doing.

The concepts covered in today's lab (functions that receive input and return output) will be VERY VERY helpful for you in our next big project. Ideally you will continue to work on little problems like this for additional practice.
