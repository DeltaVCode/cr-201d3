# Class 7: JS Arrays

<a id="top"></a>
## Lecture 7

## Today's Schedule
- Announcements
- Code Review *[30 minutes]*
- [Go over the assigned readings](#readings) *[60 minutes]*
- Code demo *[90 minutes]*

### Announcements:
- Quizzes:
  - Note your first quiz is due Friday morning.
  - There will be some quiz content from time to time that we may not have covered yet (for instance, something on the quiz published today that we will not cover until the next class).
  - Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and also that the quizzes are designed to be treated like they are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
  - Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:
    1. To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
    2. To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 4. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (80%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.

- **Be sure to raise questions** about any topics that you'd like clarity about. If it is a topic that we will cover in the future, we'll let you know and maybe give a quick answer for now. On this day in particular, when we have so much to cover, it is important to avoid going down time-consuming rabbit-holes.

- The reasons for going over the JS chapters in so much detail this morning, even though they do overlap with the pre-work quite a bit:
  1. Not everyone got the same amount of benefit/knowledge from completing pre-work.
  2. There are gaps, and omissions, and depth of the subject matter that need to be addressed.
  3. We're focusing on translating the basic knowledge in the books into "how we use this" skills, and getting practice in applying this material within our new IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of VSCode, Chrome, and the terminal.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Lecture 7 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of assorted data types such as booleans, strings, integers, floats in JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
