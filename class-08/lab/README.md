# Assignment Overview: Lab 8

For this lab we will be adding a few things to the work we've done so far. Use the User Stories and the Technical Requirements to make a plan for how to proceed. Assume that all user stories from the previous lab carry over, except for the ones that are modified or are superseded here.

It can be very handy to take notes and sketch things out when you are planning your projects and the code within it.

## Workflow

- Make sure you **merge your previous Pull Request**, **update (`pull`) your local `master`**, and **create a new branch** before starting today's lab.
  - Reminder that assignments may be resubmitted after you have addressed TA feedback. You may either push additional commits to your Pull Request before merging, or merge your Pull Request as submitted and create another branch and Pull Request to address the feedback. In either case, include the appropriate Pull Request link when you resubmit or it will not be graded.

## Requirements

### User Stories (MVP... what you must do as a minimum)

- As a developer, I want to be able to debug my code by using well structured console messages.
- As a developer, I want to consider the user experience (UX) of my About Me and guessing game, trying to view it through the eyes of a user. Wait... maybe I should just write a user story for that...
- As a prospective job seeker, I want to consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception.
- As a quiz participant, I want to be asked five yes/no questions, so that I can guess the answers and get to know the subject of the portfolio.
- As a quiz participant, I want to be asked a sixth question that prompts for numeric input (e.g., "What is my favorite number?" or "How many Pok√©mon did I catch this week?").
- As a number guesser, I want to be told if a guess is 'too high' or 'too low', so that I may refine my guess.
- As a number guesser, I want to be given at most four opportunities to get the correct answer, so that I'm not stuck guessing forever.
- As a quiz participant, I want to be asked a seventh question that has multiple possible correct answers (e.g. "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Iowa?").
- As a multiple-choice guesser, I want to be given at most six opportunities to get the correct answer.
- As a multiple-choice guesser, I want to eventually be shown all correct answers, so that I learn more about the subject of the portfolio.
- As a technical reviewer, I want to see answers to the multiple-choice question stored in an array.
- As a quiz participant, I want to be shown the total number of correct answers I have given at the end of the game, so that I can receive a personalized message about my resounding success or abject failure (e.g. "You got 4 out of 7 questions correct, Bobbi! Better luck next time.").

### User Stories (Stretch goals... not required!)

- As a technical reviewer, I want to see the yes/no questions and answers stored in one or more arrays.
- As a technical reviewer, I want to see the yes/no game logic use a `for` loop to control the flow from question to question.
- As a quiz partipant, I want the number-guessing question to have a random correct answer, so that I can't just memorize the answer.
- As a quiz participant, I want to see the questions and my answers within the page instead of as alerts.
- As a quiz participant, I want to see the layout of the quiz page before I'm asked the first question.
  - _In most browsers, the quiz page itself will not be displayed until all prompts/alerts are complete. Can you figure out how to let the page load before the questions are asked?_

### Technical Requirements

- Most students use both `for` and `while` structures between their sixth and seventh questions. But not necessarily.

### Technical Restrictions

- Do not use forms for receiving input from the user, even if you are attempting a stretch goal.
- Do not write any functions in your JavaScript, unless you are attempting a stretch goal that requires a function.

## Submitting Your Assignment

- Create a Pull Request from today's branch into `master`
- Submit that Pull Request link (e.g. `https://github.com/dahlbyk/about-me/pull/1`) in Canvas
  - We will not accept a link to the repository (e.g. `https://github.com/dahlbyk/about-me`)
  - We will not accept a link to the branch (e.g. `https://github.com/dahlbyk/about-me/tree/mon-questions`)
  - Why? Pull Requests allow us to provide line-by-line feedback.
- Add a comment to this Canvas submission with answers to the following questions:
  - How did this go, overall?
  - What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?
