# Assignment Overview: Lab 2

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML and JS project.

- Note that as we progress through the week, new user stories will be added to the "About Me" project to guide the development of new features.

### User Stories for "About Me" (MVP)

("MVP" = "Minimum Viable Product" which is the most basic successful functionality of our project. Extensions, added features, and other enhancements fall under the category of "Stretch Goals.")

This is our first exposure to user stories. This is a device commonly used in software development to identify what the functionality and design of a product should be by considering the interests and motivations of people with varied multiple points of view.

User stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that structure.

- As a student, I want to create an About Me page as a demonstration of my skills with HTML.
- As an eventual jobseeker, I want to get practice in creating a portfolio page so that I can make myself appealing to potential employers.
- As an eventual jobseeker, I would like for potential employers to quickly learn a few things about me, such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.
- As a fun-loving human being, I want to give the visitors to my About Me page a guessing game that shows how fun-loving and interesting I am, and maybe include things about myself that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page.
- As a developer, I want to use markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.
- As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others, manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.

### Technical Requirements for "About Me"

- Follow the instructions in the adjacent ["Setting Up a New Code 201 Project"](./setting-up-a-new-project.md) document
- HTML and CSS must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. 
- Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have
- Create an ordered list to display your top ten video games or movies. 
- Create an unordered list of work experience or facts about you.
- Create a second page to show new content by way of a navigational link(anchor tag) from the index.html page. 
- Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; it is evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.

### Supporting Information

#### Git

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

##### Git command basics:

- `git status`
   - Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory

- `git add <file/s>`
   - Include file/s in staged/tracked status of working directory; you can use `.` as a wildcard to capture all files

- `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   - Snapshot the tracked changes in current working directory, with a brief message describing the changes

- `git push <destination> <branch>`
   - Push local commits to GitHub

### Add, Commit, Push (ACP): Learn it. Know it. Live it.
