# Class 2: HTML,CSS Introduction

<a id="top"></a>
## Lecture 2

## Today's Schedule
- Announcements
- [Code Review](#codereview) *[30 minutes]*
- [Learning Journal](#lj) *[15 minutes]*
- [Topics from HTML readings](#html) *[15 minutes]*
- [Topics from CSS readings](#css) *[30 minutes]*

### Announcements:

- There will be lots of detail work today on CSS. We're going forward with the expectation that you will need instruction on HTML concepts and overview of practices, and the specifics of how to interface with CSS.

- **Be sure to raise questions** about any topics that you'd like clarity about. If it is a topic that we will cover in the future, we'll let you know and maybe give a quick answer for now. On this day in particular, when we have so much to cover, it is important to avoid going down time-consuming rabbit-holes.

- The reasons for going over CSS chapters in so much detail this morning, even though they do overlap with the pre-work quite a bit:
  1. Not everyone got the same amount of benefit/knowledge from completing pre-work.
  2. There are gaps, and omissions, and depth of the subject matter that need to be addressed.
  3. We're focusing on translating the basic knowledge in the books into "how we use this" skills, and getting practice in applying this material within our new IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of VSCode, Chrome, and the terminal.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Lecture 2 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of and explain what HTML element attributes are and how to use them, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of introductory CSS concepts and techniques from Chapter 10 of the textbook
- Demonstrate understanding of and illustrate the CSS box model, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate understanding of CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment

## Code Review

Let's take about 30 minutes to do our first code review session. We're going to look at someone's code, have students read through it and explain it, take questions, and so on. Code review is an important part of professional development processes and also a key part of our learning environment in this course.
