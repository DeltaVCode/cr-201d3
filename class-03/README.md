# Agile/Scrum Bootcamp

## Overview

NewBoCo's multi-day Agile/Scrum bootcamp is designed for teams that already understand why they should adopt Agile methods and now want to know how. This likely isn't you right now, and that's ok. You're going to love it anyway :wink:

In addition to some classroom-style training, this bootcamp contains several hours of hands-on activities and labs designed to simulate all the Scrum ceremonies and best practices. Participants will leave this training with a mental toolbox filled with practical experience that will allow them to go back to their teams and immediately start sprinting. While the hope is that you will implement many of the mindset changes in your daily work, you'll likely get the most use out of them during your project weeks.

## Learning Objectives

### Day One

Day one is an introduction to the Agile mindset and the most popular Agile methodology, Scrum. While we will talk about practicalities, the first day is largely theoretical.

By the end of the day, you'll be able to:
* Describe the general principles behind an Agile mindset
* Describe how working with an Agile methodology differs from 'traditional' stage-gate work
* Explain a bit of Agile's history, why it was created, and the kinds of work it is best suited for
* Explain the difference between an Agile principle, practice and methodology and how they are related
* Describe the Scrum methodology including
  * The Scrum roles
  * The Scrum artifacts
  * The Scrum ceremonies

### Day Two

Day two is a much more practical dive into the practices that make Scrum work. Not only will we talk about them, but we'll roll up our sleeves and practice many of them.

By the end of the day, you'll understand
* Creating a product vision
* The backlog
* Writing user stories
* Writing Acceptance criteria
* Agile planning and estimation
* Tracking work through an iteration (Sprint)
* Making work visible

## Readings

We'll cover everything you need to know in class, but that's going to go a lot more smoothly if the concepts aren't brand new to you. Please read through the following prior to coming to class day one.
- [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/): This thing is literally no more than ten lines long, no big whoop.
- [The 12 Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html): Twelve principles. Another two minute read. While you're reading them, though, _be mindful of whether any of them resonate with you strongly, and if so, why_.
- [The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf): Finally, a document with some meat on its bones! This document describes the entire Scrum framework: all the artifacts, all the roles, all the ceremonies. Guess what. It's still only 19 pages and is a pretty easy read. Just like with the principles, while you're reading, _note things that stick out to you as strange or especially compelling_.

That's it, easy-peasy. Come to class ready to talk, interact and have some fun.
