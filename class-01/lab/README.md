# Assignment Overview: Lab 1

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML page

- Note that as we progress through the week, new features will be added to the "About Me" project to guide the development of the "About Me".

## Technical Requirements

- You may do the work in the same HTML file that we used for our class demo today. Because the originals from class are saved in the class GitHub repo, there is no worry in overwriting them or need for saving an unnecessary extra copy.

1. Create an index.html file.
2. Inside your newly created index.html file create a `<head>`, and `<body>` tag.
3. In your `<head>` tag create a stylesheet link to add a .css file
4. Now inside your `<body>` tag we want the following tags:
   - `<main>`, this is where our main content lives.
   - `<h1>`, we will use this as our page's main title.
   - `<p>`, tell us about yourself.
   - `<footer>`, put a copyright here with your name.
5. If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away.
