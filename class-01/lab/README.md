# Assignment Overview: Lab 1

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML page

- Note that as we progress through the week, new features will be added to the "About Me" project to guide the development of the "About Me".

## Technical Requirements

- You may do the work in the same HTML file that we used for our class demo today. Because the originals from class are saved in the class GitHub repo, there is no worry in overwriting them or need for saving an unnecessary extra copy.

1. Create an index.html file.
2. Inside your newly created index.html file create a `<head>`, and `<body>` tag.
3. In your `<head>` tag create a `<link>` to add a .css file.
4. Now inside your `<body>` tag we want the following tags:
   - `<main>`, this tag specifies the main content of the page.
   - `<h1>`, this tag defines the most important heading for the page.
   - `<p>`, This tag defines a paragraph, use it here to tell us about yourself.
   - `<footer>`, tag defines a footer for a document or section, use it here to put a copyright symbol with your name at the bottom of the page.
5. If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away.
