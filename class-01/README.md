## Verify Student Toolbelts

By doing a few quick tests and exercises, as detailed below, we will ensure that you have functionality of all of the core pieces of your development environment:
- VSCode: type `code` in the command line to verify that it opens properly. Command line tools may need to be installed
- VSCode packages: ensure that Live Server is enabled
- Chrome: how to open Developer Tools
- Git: enter `which git` in the command line to verify installation
- Directory structure: together we will set up a directory at ~/deltav/201/ in which you will store your classwork. We will go over directory structure in general and compare it to GUI
