# Assignment Overview: Lab 6

- Write a program that accepts user input and, based on that input, displays messages back to the user.

## Workflow

Last week, all work was done in the `master` branch.
This week, each day you'll be working in separate branches.
Branch names can be whatever you want; it is suggested that you use some sort of standard organization such as `day-feature` for the branch name, such as `mon-questions`.

## Technical Requirements

- Include in your repository the following files, whose contents are copied from the class repository. **These are required for all future projects.**
  - `.gitattributes`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `.eslintrc.json`
- Add a new `questions.html` page to your About Me project, linked from your navigation.
- Using a total of four JavaScript 'prompt' or 'confirm' statements along the lines of our class demo from today, have a user answer four questions.
- The user's response to each question (input) should be stored in a separate variable. Name your variables carefully.
- Using these responses, return an alert to the user (output) that concatenates their response into some kind of reply like we did in class.
- Strive to have your alert for each question utilize the responses to all of the prior questions such that by the fourth question, your response would look something like, "Greetings, *Iggy* from *Ipanema*, I also like to eat *bananas* while on vacation in *Paris*."
- Be creative and have fun with your questions/responses! They can be whatever you want so long as the input/output requirements are met.
- In addition, for each response, create a console.log() message that indicates the nature of the question and the user's response, as we did in class.
- If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away.

### Stretch Goals

- We'll introduce DOM manipulation next week, but see if you can research on your own how to read the questions from HTML and/or write the user's answers into the page.

## Submitting Your Assignment

- Create a Pull Request from today's branch into `master`
- Submit that Pull Request link (e.g. `https://github.com/dahlbyk/about-me/pull/1`) in Canvas
  - We will not accept a link to the repository (e.g. `https://github.com/dahlbyk/about-me`)
  - We will not accept a link to the branch (e.g. `https://github.com/dahlbyk/about-me/tree/mon-questions`)
  - Why? Pull Requests allow us to provide line-by-line feedback.
- Make sure you **merge your Pull Request** and **update (`pull`) your local `master`** before starting tomorrow's lab.
  - Reminder that assignments may be resubmitted after you have addressed TA feedback. You may either push additional commits to your Pull Request before merging, or merge your Pull Request as submitted and create another branch and Pull Request to address the feedback. In either case, include the appropriate Pull Request link when you resubmit or it will not be graded.
